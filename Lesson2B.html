            // See annotation in Lesson 1 to parse these variables
            let canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
            let context = canvas.getContext('2d');

            // Array: See previous lesson for fuller overview
            let color = ['DarkRed', 'Tomato', 'Pink', 'Gold', 'LimeGreen', 'Teal', 'SteelBlue', 'Purple'];
            
            // Variables
            // Notice how some variables simply point to numbers or strings.
            // There are two special ways to declare a variable. The first is using the word "let", as seen above and in other places in our code. 
            // The second uses the word "const". Const is for variables that are constant and unchanging. We don't adjust these variables theh whole time, so we can use const here.
            const height = 50;
            const width = 50;
            const gap = 25;
            // However, in our upcoming loop, x and y will change. So it is important to identify these variables with "let".
            // Notice how in Javascript, we don't even need to point to a value for these variables yet. We just need to identify them as something that we will eventually use.
            let x, y;

            // Yet other variables are defined by other objects in the code, like this one that ties number of maxIndex to the length of an array (in this case, the array called "color")
            let maxIndex = color.length;

            // Nested "For" Loops
            // For loops enable the computer to go through information and/or commands until a condition has been met.
            // For loops contain three parameters.
            // In this case, we define the first parameter as the variable index (traditionally notated with "i"). (A secondary index, as seen in the nested for loop is often indicated by "j", the letter after "i")
            // In the second parameter, we set the condition in which the for loop will be broken (as long as it is less than maxLength)
            // In the third and final parameter, we tell the computer how to change the condition as it goes through each set of commands contained within the for loop. (In this case, to increment "i" by 1 after completing each loop)

            // Practical Note: Nesting "for" loops create a lot of functionality, but it also increases processing time (measured in what is called "Big O" Notation).
            // A nested "for" loop creates quadratic time complexity, as the program loops through the information in the array time after time after time; in Big O Notation, this is O(n^2). This is to be avoided if the code is to be scaled, but works just fine here for our purposes.
            // To review Big O Notation, try https://medium.com/@lmonty22/big-o-notation-avoiding-nested-loops-2924f3002a08 or for a more scientifically in depth discussion, try this article from MIT: https://web.mit.edu/16.070/www/lecture/big_o.pdf
            for (let i = 0; i < maxIndex; i++) {
                for (let j = 0; j < maxIndex; j++) {
                    // Define the color of the crayon the computer is picking up and where to put it to start the drawing process
                    context.strokeStyle = color[i];
                    context.lineWidth = 5;
                    x = 100 + (width + gap) * i;
                    y = 100 + (width + gap) * j;

                    // This block of text draws the larger square
                    context.beginPath();
                    context.rect(x, y, width, height);
                    context.stroke();

                    // Introducing Contitionals
                    // Conditionals are expressions which calculate a true or false (boolean) statement
                    // If the statement found within the () parameters is true, the block of code within the "if"'s {} will execute.
                    // It is also possible to add "else if" and "else" statements to create options for execution. We will surely see this in later files.
                    // Note: Math.random is another math function which produces a random number between 0 and 1. 
                    // Thie means that as the page is refreshed, the small squares will change location each time. 
                    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
                        // This block of text draws the smaller square
                        context.beginPath();
                        context.rect(x + 10, y + 10, width - 20, height - 20);
                        context.stroke();
                    } 
                 
                }

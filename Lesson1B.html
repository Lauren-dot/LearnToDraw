        <!-- the "canvas" tag creates a canvas that we can draw on -->

            let canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
            // What is happening in line 10? Let me explain:
            //"let" is a special phrase that creates a variable (or kind of pointer to information)
            // "=" means assignment of the variable, not that it is equivelent to or balanced with (== is equivilent to)
            // "document" refers to this set of script, specifically, it is a Javascript object that refers to the HTML document we are working with
            // "." states that we want a part of the object (in this case, document)
            // "querySelector" selects an element from the document
            // "()" tells the computer that there will be parameters that help to define this action
            // "'canvas'" is the example name of the parameter we want, and since the name is a string, it is in single quotes ''
            // ";" tells the computer that this Javascript script is finished
            // Now, with all that out of the way, this is what that looks like in Javascript code:
            
            //To draw, the canvas needs a context (Will this be a 2d or a 3d picture? To draw, we need to know)
            let context = canvas.getContext('2d');

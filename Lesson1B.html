        <!-- the "canvas" tag creates a canvas that we can draw on -->
        <!-- width and height attributes dictate the size of the canvas in pixels-->
        <canvas width="800" height="800"></cavas>

            //Note: inside the script tag, comments need a different indicator!
            let canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
            // What is happening in line 10? Let me explain:
            //"let" is a special phrase that creates a variable (or kind of pointer to information)
            // "=" means assignment of the variable, not that it is equivelent to or balanced with (== is equivilent to)
            // "document" refers to this set of script, specifically, it is a Javascript object that refers to the HTML document we are working with
            // "." states that we want a part of the object (in this case, document)
            // "querySelector" selects an element from the document
            // "()" tells the computer that there will be parameters that help to define this action
            // "'canvas'" is the example name of the parameter we want, and since the name is a string, it is in single quotes ''
            // ";" tells the computer that this line is done (C and other languages use this syntax too)
            // You will see this pattern of identifying an object and requesting an attribute of that object again and again.
            // See if you can figure out this same pattern using the next variable, "context"
            // Now, with all that out of the way, this is what that looks like in Javascript code:
            
            // To draw, the canvas needs a context (Will this be a 2d or a 3d picture? To draw, we need to know)
            let context = canvas.getContext('2d');

            // This creates a filled-in rectangle on the 2d canvas
            context.fillRect(200, 200, 400, 400);
            // The first two numbers in the () are the x (which goes across/horizontally) and y (which goes up and down/vertically) coordinates
            // These first two coordinates dictate where the rectangle will start being drawn; they are measured in pixels
            // The second two numbers are the size of the rectangle, also measured in pixels

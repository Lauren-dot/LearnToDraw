        <!-- the "canvas" tag creates a canvas that we can draw on -->
        <!-- width and height attributes dictate the size of the canvas in pixels-->
        <canvas width="800" height="800"></cavas>
        
        <!-- the "script" tag is where we put the active code, or the code that will be run by the browser -->

            //Note: inside the script tag, comments need a different indicator!
            let canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
            // What is happening in line 10? Let me explain:
            //"let" is a special phrase that creates a variable (or kind of pointer to information)
            // "=" means assignment of the variable, not that it is equivelent to or balanced with (== is equivilent to)
            // "document" refers to this set of script, specifically, it is a Javascript object that refers to the HTML document we are working with
            // "." states that we want a part of the object (in this case, document)
            // "querySelector" selects an element from the document
            // "()" tells the computer that there will be parameters that help to define or are needed to help inform how to fulfill this action
            // "'canvas'" is the example name of the parameter we want, and since the name is a string, it is in single quotes ''
            // ";" tells the computer that this line is done (C and other languages use this syntax too)
            // You will see this pattern of identifying an object and requesting an attribute of that object again and again.
            // See if you can figure out this same pattern using the next variable, "context"
            // Now, with all that out of the way, this is what that looks like in Javascript code:
            // But first...
            // To draw, the canvas needs a context (Will this be a 2d or a 3d picture? To draw, the computer need to know)
            let context = canvas.getContext('2d');

            // Notice how this next line of code is not a variable or a function. It is a property. Yet it's still a property which holds a value. (In this case, pink. If it was not defined, it would just be black.)
            // Before we draw even a simple shape on our canvas using our context, we need to define the style of what we will draw
            // You can experiment by putting this property below the .fillRect attribute. 
            // Will the rectangle still be pink (or another color of your choice?)? No. The computer needs to know the correct crayon in hand before it draws anything.
            context.fillStyle = 'pink';

            // This creates a filled-in rectangle on the 2d canvas
            context.fillRect(200, 200, 400, 400);
            // The first two numbers in the () are the x (which goes across/horizontally) and y (which goes up and down/vertically) coordinates
            // These first two coordinates dictate where the rectangle will start being drawn; they are measured in pixels
            // The second two numbers are the size of the rectangle, also measured in pixels


            //Now, let's practice this process by creating an outline for the rectangle.
            //Can you follow along with what is happening? Use documentation like https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API 
            //Or https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_canvas.asp or for details like line color, https://www.html5canvastutorials.com/tutorials/html5-canvas-line-color/ to help you out.
            context.strokeStyle = "green";
            context.lineWidth = 10;
            context.beginPath();
            context.rect(200, 200, 400, 400);
            context.stroke();
            //Notice how the styles for the line are defined first, then path and location and size, then the command to draw the line

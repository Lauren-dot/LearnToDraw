# LearnToDraw
Learning to draw using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS; annotated code

The purpose of this project is to learn how to create art using only code. 
I annotate my code as I go so I can use it as a teaching tool for myself (or you can use it as a learning aide, if you are bothering to read this). 
I will be coding along a course by Bruno Imbrizi on Domestika called Creative Coding.
The purpose of this space is not to copy Mr. Imbrizi's code, but rather to code alongside to see where my new skills take me and make notes to myself for future use. 
Similar to the stitching samplers I make when I use a new embriodery book.

Annotation means that the code itself will be more full of "explainers" that typical code. 
Typical comments tend to be used as labels, and are often used sparingly. That is not the purpose of annotated code. 
The purpose of annotated code is to create a written guide. It is meant to walk you through, holding your hand.
Annotation is a common means of communication to other generations or even contemporary scholars in my first career. 
It is familiar to me, but I understand how it might seem verbose to some. That is okay. There is plenty of non-annotated similar code out there.
And fortunately, since comments are "greyed out", it should not be too terribly distracting.
Hopefully, it will be helpful to other new learners interested in the intersection of art and technology. Or just me. That's okay too.
